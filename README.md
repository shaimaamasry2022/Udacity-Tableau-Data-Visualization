# Udacity-Tableau-Data-Visualization
In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a flight cancellation data set using Tableau.

# Dataset: Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset at the following link: https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a3b1fad_flight-delays/flight-delays.zip
# General Description:
I have a created a story for the Flights Data Source. The story board is designed in way that in each part of the story board, the user can dig further into details, to get more information and answers. The story board can be found at the following link: FlightStory-ShaimaaMasry | Tableau Public
The story board is designed to answer the following questions:
1.	Which states show the most arrival delays ?
2.	What is the percentage of Total Arrival Delay of each airline per each state?
3.	What is the total arrival delay of each airline for each airport per each state?
4.	What are the reasons of arrival delays in general? Do these reasons change by day of the week ?
5.	Which of these reasons cause the most delay for each airline? 
# Main Findings:
*	There are five types of delays: Departure Delay, Late Aircraft Delay, Airline Delay, Air System Delay, Security delay
*	The Departure Delay is the highest, followed by the Late Aircraft Delay, the Airline Delay, the Air System Delay and lastly the Security Delay. 
*	Filtering by the States CA (California) or TX (Texas), we find that the same order of delay types apply.
*	Filtering by Day of the Week, the order of the delays does not change, however the values of the delays change from one day to another during the week.  It is noticed that the values of all delays increase in the week end, especially on Sunday (Day 7).
   ## Specific Findings for CA:
*	Looking at the second bar chart in the Dashboard for the state CA, we find that the Departure Delay has the highest contribution for all of CA airlines . 
*	The WN airline shows highest departure delay (110,506 min) when compared to the remaining airlines.
   Specific Findings for TX:
*	Looking at the second bar chart in the Dashboard for the state TX we find that the Departure Delay has the highest contribution for all of TX airlines . 
*	The WN airline, followed by the AA airline show the highest departure delay (80,536 min, 70, 222 min respectively) when compared to the remaining airlines.
